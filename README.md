# Console Car Game - A Simple C++ Racing Game

This project is a simple console-based car game developed in C++. The game involves navigating a car along a road while avoiding randomly generated obstacles (trees). It is designed to showcase skills in C++ programming, real-time input handling, and basic game mechanics.

## Key Features:
- **Real-Time Gameplay:** Control the car using keyboard inputs to avoid obstacles as they appear on the road.
- **Randomized Obstacles:** Obstacles are generated randomly to ensure a unique experience in each game session.
- **High Score Tracking:** The game saves and displays the highest score achieved across sessions.
- **Collision Detection:** Implements basic collision detection to determine when the car hits an obstacle, ending the game.

## How to Play:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the C++ code using any standard C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable and use the 'a' and 'd' keys to move the car left and right.
4. Avoid obstacles and try to achieve a high score!

## Potential Enhancements:
- Adding different levels of difficulty.
- Implementing power-ups or bonuses to increase gameplay variety.
- Improving the visual presentation using ASCII art or integrating simple graphics.
